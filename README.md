# Protein Folding using Motifs

Modeling protein folding using a constraint satisfaction formulation based on interaction motifs. We fold a protein 5DMA(https://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/5DMA) of size 53.   

The motif library used for interactions is tailored to the specific protein that needs to be folded. These motifs consist of pairs of amino acids (2+2), making it the smallest motif approach capable of folding proteins larger than 50 amino acids. In comparison, DeepMind's AlphaFold uses motifs of size 64.
